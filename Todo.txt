TODO LIST

__GIMP PLUGIN__
not very robust, also needs cleanup (e.g. don't hard-code values if possible)
read file input as a parameter?
automatically save output file?

__GENERAL__
Restrict rivers to starting on mountain/certain elevations - maybe
Generalize river propagation for rivers extending to adjacent, not just below tiles
Unify drawing for tile vs maps, e.g. map draw can call tile draw can call mtn/river draw(x,y coord input)
mtns could have a method that takes in all mtns that impact that tile and return the altitude at (x,y)
Drawing methods and testing for river class
Add river elevation checks
3D graphing of mtns? maybe GnuPlot or some added Python lib
Implement max/min height per tile/map
Contour maps
Add noise to mtns
Different x,y slopes
Allow arbitrary characters in random seed
