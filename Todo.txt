TODO LIST

CODE CLEANUP!!!!

__GIMP PLUGIN__
not very robust, also needs cleanup (e.g. don't hard-code values if possible)
read file input as a parameter?
automatically save output file?

__GENERAL__
rivers, mountains, etc. need drawXY methods to unify the per-tile and map-wide drawing functions
modify beach to work vertically as well as horizontally
"tile.Tile(x,y,maxMtns,maxRivers..." : move these max<X> variables into a list or dictionary for passing to function
Restrict rivers to starting on mountain/certain elevations - maybe
Generalize river propagation for rivers extending to adjacent, not just below tiles
Unify drawing for tile vs maps, e.g. map draw can call tile draw can call mtn/river draw(x,y coord input)
mtns could have a method that takes in all mtns that impact that tile and return the altitude at (x,y)
Contour maps
Add noise to mtns
Different x,y slopes
Allow arbitrary characters in random seed
