TODO LIST

__ZONING__
also support zoning based on x values

__GIMP PLUGIN__
not very robust, also needs cleanup (e.g. don't hard-code values if possible)
read file input as a parameter?
automatically save output file?
Contour maps

__GENERAL__
if river intersects an existing river, kill the 2nd one (essentially merging the 2)
radius = int(self.mtnList[m].h/PARAM_MTN_MAX_SLOPE)+1   #+1 to prevent rounding/division problems
    - radius can be split into x "radius" and y "radius" based on individual x and y slopes
modify beach to work vertically as well as horizontally
"tile.Tile(x,y,maxMtns,maxRivers..." : move these max<X> variables into a list or dictionary for passing to function
Generalize river propagation for rivers extending to adjacent, not just below tiles
    -if 2 rivers heading different directions meet, stop propagation and form a lake (stop propagation so we don't end up with
     a river flowing down from a mountain and up another mountain then stopping)
mtns could have a method that takes in all mtns that impact that tile and return the altitude at (x,y)
Add noise to mtns
shouldn't need to pass mountain list as argument to draw methods - store mountain input per tile in that tile itself
Different x,y slopes
Allow arbitrary characters in random seed
