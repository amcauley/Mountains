TODO LIST

__ZONING__
support for oceans and beaches
    - support for last tile, 1 from last, 1st tile, 2nd, etc instead of only percentages
        -maybe enter "y%" to represent location as a percentage, "y" interpreted as absolute
        y value, "-y" counts from the end point. assert if absolute values go out of range
also support zoning based on x values

__GIMP PLUGIN__
not very robust, also needs cleanup (e.g. don't hard-code values if possible)
read file input as a parameter?
automatically save output file?
Contour maps

__GENERAL__
modify beach to work vertically as well as horizontally
"tile.Tile(x,y,maxMtns,maxRivers..." : move these max<X> variables into a list or dictionary for passing to function
Generalize river propagation for rivers extending to adjacent, not just below tiles
mtns could have a method that takes in all mtns that impact that tile and return the altitude at (x,y)
Add noise to mtns
shouldn't need to pass mountain list as argument to draw methods - store mountain input per tile in that tile itself
Different x,y slopes
Allow arbitrary characters in random seed
